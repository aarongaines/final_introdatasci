# Estimating Groundwater Elevation with Machine Learning

This repository is the final project for the Introduction to Data Science course at the UCLA extension program. 

## Project Overview

The general goals of this project are to estimate groundwater depth at monitoring wells across Los Angeles, California. The project proposal and data used can be found in the final.ipynb notebook. The data required is found in the data folder and should be left as is. The generated cleaned data file is also included in the data folder so there is no need to run the preprocessing steps. The packages and data required for each section are provided so you can run each section independently if desired.
